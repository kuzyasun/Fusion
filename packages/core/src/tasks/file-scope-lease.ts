FNXC:WorkspaceFileOverlap 2026-08-30-19:14:
Workspace tasks deliberately clear the singular `task.worktree` through
`normalizeWorkspaceTaskWorktreeMetadata({ clearSingularWorktree: true })`, so overlap lifetime must also
recognize their per-repository checkouts. A retained entry is the unfinished-work proof; executor and archive
cleanup delete those entries when the checkout is removed, preserving checkout clearing as the early-release hatch.

FNXC:OverlapScheduling 2026-09-01-14:49:
A planning-only card owns neither checkout form and therefore owns no file-scope lease; planning never
serializes planning. A hold-lane card retaining a real checkout after execution still owns unmerged work
and deliberately keeps its dormant lease. Checkout evidence, not a column exception, decides the outcome.

more serialization is acceptable, while missing a qualified peer would admit conflicting edits. Explicit repository
paths remain untouched, and tasks without repository checkouts retain the exact single-repository scope behavior.

age, then task id so two waiting holders choose one deterministic winner instead of freezing each other.
